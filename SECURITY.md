## Reporting a Vulnerability

The BetterTab team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in BetterTab, please report it to us as soon as possible.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to:

**pogried@gmail.com**

Please include the following details with your report:

* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* The version of BetterTab affected (if known).
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability. This is crucial for us to verify and fix the issue.
* Any potential impact of the vulnerability.
* If you have a proof-of-concept or exploit code, please include it.
* Your name and a way to contact you (if you wish to be credited).

## Our Commitment

* We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
* We will investigate the reported vulnerability and aim to provide an initial assessment within 72 hours.
* We will work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
* We will keep you informed of our progress.
* We will publicly credit you for your discovery if you wish, once the vulnerability has been addressed.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the BetterTab application and its codebase. If you believe you've found a vulnerability in a third-party library used by BetterTab, please report it to the library's maintainers as well.

## Security Best Practices for Users

* Always download BetterTab from the official [Releases page](https://github.com/daniil-pogorelov/Better-Tab/releases) on GitHub.
* Keep your macOS operating system up to date with the latest security patches.
* Be cautious about granting Accessibility permissions and ensure you understand why an application requires them. BetterTab requires these permissions for its core functionality of monitoring keyboard events and managing application windows.

Thank you for helping keep BetterTab secure!
